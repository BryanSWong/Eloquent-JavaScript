/*
 The indexOf method on strings cannot be called with a regular expression.
 But there is another method, search, which does expect a regular expression.
 Like indexOf, it returns the first index on which the expression was found,
 or -1 when it wasn’t found.

console.log("  word".search(/\S/));

console.log("     ".search(/\S/));
