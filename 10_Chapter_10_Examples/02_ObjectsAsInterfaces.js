 one that goes from a day name to a number. We canâ€™t simply return the function
 anymore but must wrap the two functions in an object.

 A convenient alternative is to declare an object (conventionally named exports)
 and add properties to that whenever we are defining something that needs to be
 exported. In the following example, the module function takes its interface object
 as an argument, allowing code outside of the function to create it and store it in
 a variable. (Outside of a function, this refers to the global scope object.)
