/*

 The higher-order operation that represents this pattern is called reduce
  (or sometimes fold). You can think of it as folding up the array, one
  element at a time. When summing numbers, youâ€™d start with the number
  zero, and for each element, combine it with the current sum by adding
  the two.

 The parameters to the reduce function are, apart from the array,
 a combining function and a start value. This function is a little
 less straightforward than filter and map, so pay careful attention.

function reduce(array, combine, start){

    var current = start;

    for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++)

    current = combine(current, array[i]);

    return current;

}

console.log(reduce([1,2,3,4], function(a,b){

    return a + b;

}, 0)); // 10


console.log(reduce([1,2,3,4], function(a,b){

    return a + b;

}, 40)); //50
